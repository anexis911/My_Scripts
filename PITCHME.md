# Flux 

An application architecture for React

#HSLIDE

### Flux Design

- Dispatcher: Manages Data Flow
- Stores: Handle State & Logic
- Views: Render Data via React

#### Python example

```python
import multiprocessing
from netmiko import ConnectHandler
import sys
import yaml


COMMAND = sys.argv[1]
devices = yaml.load(open('devices.yaml'))

def connect_ssh(device_dict, command, queue):
    ssh = ConnectHandler(**device_dict)
    ssh.enable()
    result = ssh.send_command(command)

    print "Connection to device %s" % device_dict['ip']
    queue.put({device_dict['ip']: result})


def conn_processes(function, devices, command):
    processes = []
    queue = multiprocessing.Queue()

    for device in devices:
        p = multiprocessing.Process(target = function,
                                    args = (device, command, queue))
        p.start()
        processes.append(p)

    for p in processes:
        p.join()

    results = []
    for p in processes:
        results.append(queue.get())

    return results

print( conn_processes(connect_ssh, devices['routers'], COMMAND) )
